1. As we have seen in the lecture videos, the dot product of vectors has a lot of applications. Here, you will complete some exercises involving the dot product.

We have seen that the size of a vector with two components is calculated using Pythagoras' theorem, for example the following diagram shows how we calculate the size of the orange vector $$r=\begin{bmatrix}
    r_{1} \\
    r_{2}
    \end{bmatrix}$$

   - [x] AI controls the power grids for energy distribution, so all the power needed for industry and in daily life comes from AI.
   - [ ] AI helps to create a more efficient way of producing energy to power industries and personal devices.
   - [ ] AI is an essential ingredient in realizing tasks, in industry and in personal life.
    > ✖️ <span style="color: red;">**Incorrect**</br>No. There will always be areas in the world where AI is not a feasible option because of lack of infrastructures.</span>

7. A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, and economic growth is an example of “unstructured” data because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?

    - [ ] True
    - [x] False
    > ✔️ <spane style="color: green;">**Correct**</br>A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, and economic growth is an example of “structured” data in contrast to image, audio or text datasets.</span>

8. RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) are good for data with a temporal component. True/False?

    - [ ] False
    - [x] True
    > ✔️ <spane style="color: green;">**Correct**</br>Yes, RNN are designed to work with sequences; the elements of a sequence can be sorted by a temporal component.</span>

9. In this diagram which we hand-drew in the lecture, what do the horizontal axis (x-axis) and vertical axis (y-axis) represent?
![q9.png](img/q9.png)

    - [ ] x-axis is the input to the algorithm</br>y-axis is outputs.
    - [x] x-axis is the amount of data</br>y-axis (vertical axis) is the performance of the algorithm
    - [ ] x-axis is the performance of the algorithm</br>y-axis (vertical axis) is the amount of data.
    - [ ] x-axis is the amount of data</br>y-axis is the size of the model you train.
